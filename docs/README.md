## Frontend Screenshot

To add a frontend screenshot to the main README:

1. Take a screenshot of the running application at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Save it as `frontend-screenshot.png` in this directory
3. The image will automatically appear in the main README

### Recommended Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Content**: Show the main chat interface with:
  - Chat messages visible
  - Voice controls visible
  - Analytics dashboard (if open)
  - Clean, professional appearance
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB for GitHub compatibility

### Alternative Image Locations

If you prefer to store images elsewhere, update the image path in the main README.md:
- `docs/frontend-screenshot.png` (current)
- `images/frontend-screenshot.png`
- `assets/frontend-screenshot.png`
